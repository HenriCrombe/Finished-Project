Group 3 : Emergency system for falling objects
----------------------------------------------

The project is divided in two modules :
1) The server mote (UDP emergency server, border-router, web server)
2) The probe mote (emergency client, REST server)

Compiling th source :
1) Extract the project into contiki folder (or anywhere else, but the Makefile must points to contiki forlder)
2) Compile "server" sources and upload to the mote:
   - cd server
   - make emergency_server
   - sudo chown $USER:$USER /dev/ttyUSB0 
   - make MOTES=/dev/ttyUSB0 emergency_server.upload
   - make connect-router (to make the tunslip tunel between the computer and the server)
3) Compile "probe" sources and upload to mote:
   - cd probe
   - make probe
   - sudo chown $USER:$USER /dev/ttyUSB1
   - make MOTES=/dev/ttyUSB1 probe.upload

--> When the system is started and that every processes are runing:
1) The web-server of the emergency server can be accessed using a typical web-browser by visiting the URL:
   http://[aaaa::c30c:0:0:1]

2) The probe REST server can accessed :
   - make connect-router (if not yet done)
   - Open firefox and visit the URL below to connect to the probe REST server :
     coap://[aaaa::c30c:0:0:2]:5683/
   - The freefall thresholds of the mote can be changed at this URL
     coap://[aaaa::c30c:0:0:2]:5683/thresholds
   - Make a POST request with the payload set to :
     ff_time_threshold=value (OR)
     ff_accel_threshold=value
     Where value is an acceptable threshold for the accelerometer :
     ff_time_threshold = 50|100|200|300|400|500|600 miliseconds
     ff_accel_threshold = 300|600|1000 milig

--> When the system is started
